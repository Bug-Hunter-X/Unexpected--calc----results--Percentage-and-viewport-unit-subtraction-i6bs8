To address this unexpected `calc()` behavior, it is advisable to convert all units to a single unit type before performing the calculation.  For example, converting both percentages and `vw` units to pixels will provide more consistent results across browsers.

This solution typically involves JavaScript to determine the parent's width and the viewport width in pixels, then calculate the final width.  This removes the ambiguity of `calc()` handling different unit types.

Alternatively, you can explore simpler layout techniques without relying on `calc()` to solve your width requirements.
