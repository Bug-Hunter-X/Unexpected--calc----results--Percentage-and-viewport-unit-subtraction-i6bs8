The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and viewport units:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 10vw);
}
```

This code intends to make the container's width 50% of its parent, minus 10% of the viewport width. However, the result might not be what's expected in some browsers due to how `calc()` handles different unit types in subtraction.

The issue may be that the subtraction happens before unit conversion, leading to unexpected results, especially when the viewport width changes.
